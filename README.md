Work by edickie and nforde

Calculates the functional connectivity and stability between ROIs

ROIs are classified as intrahemispheric, heterotopic or homotopic 

Atlases: 
originally used aparc
can now use Glasser
and Shen at various parcellations (once I get it working)

Dataset:
POND 

Project is heavily based on the Shen 2015 paper:
Shen K, Mišić B, Cipollini BN, et al (2015) 
Stable long-range interhemispheric coordination is supported by direct anatomical projections. Proc Natl Acad Sci 112:6473–6478.
